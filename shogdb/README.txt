SHOGDB - Shoggoth Database
===============================================================================

ShogDB is an in-memory, key-value database written in the C programming language, developed by ShogAI for use in the Shoggoth project.
ShogDB is the database used by Shoggoth Nodes to store information like DHTs and pins. ShogDB also persists data on disk by periodically saving data to a file.

ShogDB uses string keys, with values of different types like:
* int
* uint
* float
* string
* bool
* JSON.

Applications can communicate with ShogDB via HTTP requests. ShogDB exposes the HTTP API at http://127.0.0.1:6961 by default.

**WARNING**
ShogDB is still early in development and should be considered unstable and experimental.
